# SierraTwo
Project Sierra is a simple encrypted reverse shell over Github, Slack, and Discord.

`SierraTwo` refers to the Slack shell, whereas `SierraOne` refers to the `Github` shell and `SierraThree` refers to the Discord shell.

## Usage
SierraTwo only supports Python 3.x. Y

### Windows
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Linux
```
$ sudo apt install python3-pip
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```


## Configuration
To use SierraTwo, create a Slack workspace where you are the admin. Afterwards go to [Slack Apps][Slack Apps]{:target="_blank"} and create a bot. From there, under the `Features` tab, go to `OAuth & Permissions` and click on `Permissions`.

## TODO:
- Divide the script into smaller functions for readability.
- Have a working exit and upload mechanism.
- Read Slack tokens from a config file.
- Add support for Windows and Linux operating systems.
- Implement a simple process injection method for Windows and Linux.
- Implement an easy-to-use obfuscated (for evasion, not anti-debugging, etc.) binary generation for Windows and Linux operating systems.

## Known Bugs:
- Sometimes channels don't get created.
- Upload sends filename as bytes output converted to string (ex: file does not exist: b'filename.txt') - Looks like an issue on Slack's side.
