# SierraTwo
Project Sierra is a simple encrypted reverse shell over Github, Slack, and Discord.

`SierraTwo` refers to the Slack shell, whereas `SierraOne` refers to the `Github` shell and `SierraThree` refers to the Discord shell.

## Usage
`SierraTwo` only supports Python 3.x.

### Windows
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python SierraTwo.py
```

### Linux
```
$ sudo apt install python3-pip
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
$ python3 SierraTwo.py
```


## Configuration
To use `SierraTwo`, create a Slack workspace where you are the admin. Afterwards go to [Slack Apps][Slack Apps] and create a bot. From there, under the `Features` tab, go to `OAuth & Permissions` and add the following scopes:

After setting the token scopes, paste your `Member ID` (your Slack ID), `OAuth Access Token` and `Bot User OAuth Token` to `config.yaml` file. Finally, install the app on the workspace.

## TODO:
- Divide the script into smaller functions for readability.
- Have a working exit and upload mechanism.
- Read Slack tokens from a config file.
- Add support for Windows and Linux operating systems.
- Implement a simple process injection method for Windows and Linux.
- Implement an easy-to-use obfuscated (for evasion, not anti-debugging, etc.) binary generation for Windows and Linux operating systems.

## Known Bugs:
- Sometimes channels don't get created.
- Upload sends filename as bytes output converted to string (ex: file does not exist: b'filename.txt') - Looks like an issue on Slack's side.
