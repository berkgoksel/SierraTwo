## TODO:
- Divide the script into smaller functions for readability.
- Add support for Windows and Linux operating systems.
- Implement a simple process injection method for Windows and Linux.
- Implement an easy-to-use obfuscated (for evasion, not anti-debugging, etc.) binary generation for Windows and Linux 
operating systems.
