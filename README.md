# SierraTwo
`SierraTwo` is a simple reverse shell over Slack.

## Usage
`SierraTwo` only supports Python 3.x. 

### Direct Usage
#### Windows
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python SierraTwo.py
```

#### Linux
```
$ sudo apt install python3-pip
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
$ python3 SierraTwo.py
```

### Building
If you'd rather build an executable instead than running `SierraTwo` with Python:

```
$ sudo apt install python3-pip wine winetricks
$ wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.2/python-3.8.2-amd64.exe
$ wine python-3.8.2-amd64.exe
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
$ wine pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python3 builder.py -o <TARGET SYSTEM>
```

The following commands will setup WINE with 64 bit Python 3.8.2 on your system. `<TARGET SYSTEM>` can be either 
`Windows` or `Linux`. For example, running `python3 builder.py -o Linux` on a 64 bit Linux with machine will generate a 
64 bit executable. Same logic applies for `-o Windows`. If you wanted to generate a 32 bit executable, you'd have to 
install 32 bit Python instead of 64 bit (on your Linux and/or WINE).

## Configuration
To use `SierraTwo`, create or be a part of a Slack workspace where you an admin. Afterwards go to 
[Slack API][Slack API] and create an app. From there, under the `Features` tab, go to `OAuth & Permissions` and add the 
following scopes:

|------------|--------------------------|

After setting the token scopes, paste your `Member ID` (your Slack ID), `OAuth Access Token` and `Bot User OAuth Token` 
to `config.py` file. Finally, install the app on the workspace.

## TODO:
- Divide the script into smaller functions for readability.
- Add support for Windows and Linux operating systems.
- Implement a simple process injection method for Windows and Linux.
- Implement an easy-to-use obfuscated (for evasion, not anti-debugging, etc.) binary generation for Windows and Linux 
operating systems.

## Known Bugs:
- Launching more than one instance of the bot causes the Slack API to kick the bot offline (The server responds with 
`{'ok': False, 'error': 'ratelimited'}`).
