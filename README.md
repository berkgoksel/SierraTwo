# TODO - Slack:
-Divide the script into smaller functions for readability.

-Have a working exit and upload mechanizm.

-Read slack tokens from a config file.

-Add support for Windows and Linux operating systems.

-Implement a simple process injection method for Windows and Linux.

-Implement an easy-to-use obfuscated(for evasion, not anti-debugging and etc.) binary generation for Windows and Linux operating systems.

# Bugs:

-Channels sometimes dont get created.

-Upload sends filename as bytes output converted to string(ex: file does not exist: b'filename.txt') - Looks like an issue on slack's side.
